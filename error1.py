"""3types of error 
1.Compile-Time Error    2.Run-Time Error   3.Logical Error
1.Compile-Time Error: If we do not follow the proper syntax and semantics of any programming language then
                    the compiler throw compile time error
                    Compiler fails to compile
                    eg.  Missing colon, Indentation
                    NO LINE OF CODE IS EXECUTED

2. Run-Time Error: A Runtime error is generated when the program is in running state. They are often termed
                    as Exception.
                    These are most difficult and lead to program crashes and bugs in your code which can be hard
                    to track down
                    eg. Lack of memory, trying to open a file that was not created, division by 0
                    UPTO ERROR LINE CODE IS EXECUTED
                    
3.Logical Error: Occurs due to poor understanding of the problem.
                    wrong formula
                    

If the programmer can guess an error on the program and he can do something to eliminate the harm
caused by that error, then it is called as Exception.
Exception are represented by class in Python: Built-in and User defined"""
